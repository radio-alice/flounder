# Flounder!

An ultra-lightweight Gemini web portal. View online at https://flounder.online/

I'm really interested in the ideas behind [Tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org/) and the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/), and wanted to make an application that takes some of the ideas behind these communities and makes a radically simple and easy-to-use version of it. [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) was another big inspiration: giving users the power and transparency of directly editing HTML, while making the process accessible and easy to learn. Gemini is such a straightforward protocol that making a static website becomes even easier!

Maybe Future Feature Ideas:

* Support [Webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention)? 

## Deployment

Flounder's ultimate goal is to be able to be easily self-hosted. If you're careful and know what you're doing, you could ry deploying it, but I haven't written any guides on how to do so yet. The Actix server is not secure as-is, I use Nginx to handle a lot of the proxying. I'll share resources when this is more stable.
